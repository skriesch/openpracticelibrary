  There is a ToC Practice:
  https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/the-theory-of-constraints/ 


  There is a book: The Phoenix Project with a story of Brent. 


  There is an idea to try to find constraint in the human network in your organisation - your Brent.

whyDo: >
  To make the life of the human bottleneck easier.

  To optimize the special constraint with all related to sensitiv character of human beings.

  To get more attention to the human network and generally to the human aspect of any affair.

  Ideally you want someone studying exactly what Brent is doing and developing tools specifically for him to make his throughput and productivity even more amazing. 


  If you take lengthy operations for him, reduce them to highly automated processes, then Brent is able to take more requests and the actual work performed is easier for Brent to teach others.


  It is not about how long it can take to realise that Brent is a constraint. It is about how long this fact is ignored and what happens when Brent is in sick leave for long time....
howTo: >
  Assumption: people involved in finding Brent read the book Phoenix Project or
  at least understand the story of Brent.


  Do a pool in your team and ask this questions:


  0. Who is a bottleneck in our team? Bang you have it!

  1. Who in our team is very smart and is right most of the time?

  2. Who is our team involved in almost every decision (i.e. technical)?

  3. Who in our team is intimidating because of how much he knows?

  4. Who in your team knows how to do everything?
